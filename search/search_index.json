If the situation is very formal, \ud569\uc1fc\uccb4 may be appropriate.  2. \ubc18\ub9d0 means \"casual/informal speech\" or \"low speech level\" - the informal casual speech level used with friends, family, and younger people.  3. \ud574\uc694\uccb4 (Informal Polite / -\uc544\uc694/\uc5b4\uc694/\ud574\uc694) is the most commonly used in daily life.  4. \ud569\uc1fc\uccb4 (Formal Polite)  5. False. You should start with \ud574\uc694\uccb4 and only switch to \ubc18\ub9d0 after establishing rapport or mutual agreement.

No, you should not mix speech levels with the same conversation partner. Pick one level and maintain consistency.  9. It means \"Let's speak casually/informally\" - the older person is suggesting both parties drop formalities and use \ubc18\ub9d0. This is a friendly gesture that indicates comfort and closeness.  10. \ud569\uc1fc\uccb4 is more formal than \ud574\uc694\uccb4.

Kim (2020) argues that grammar is the foundation of communication ability. Accordingly, this study presents effective grammar teaching methods. First, we review existing research. Next, we propose a new method. Finally, we analyze experimental results. The research results revealed that the proposed method is effective.
