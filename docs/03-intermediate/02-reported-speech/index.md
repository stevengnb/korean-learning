# Reported Speech

Reported speech (indirect speech) allows you to convey what someone else has said, asked, or commanded without quoting them directly. This is essential for natural Korean conversation.

## What is Reported Speech?

**Direct Speech**: "I'm hungry," he said.
**Reported Speech**: He said that he was hungry.

In Korean, reported speech uses specific endings attached to verbs and adjectives, then followed by 하다 (to say/do).

## Types of Reported Speech

### 1. Statements (-다고/라고 하다)
Report what someone said as a fact or statement.

**Patterns:**
- Verbs: -ㄴ다고/는다고 하다
- Adjectives/이다: -(이)라고 하다
- Past: -았/었다고 하다

**Shortened Forms:**
- -다고 → -대(요)
- -라고 → -래(요)

**Example**:
- Direct: "저는 학생이에요"
- Reported: 학생이라고 했어요 / 학생이래요

### 2. Questions (-냐고/-(으)냐고 하다)
Report questions that others asked.

**Patterns:**
- Verbs: -냐고/느냐고 하다
- Adjectives: -(으)냐고 하다
- Past: -았/었냐고 하다

**Shortened Form**: -냐고 → -래(요)

**Example**:
- Direct: "한국어를 공부해요?"
- Reported: 한국어를 공부하냐고 물었어요

### 3. Commands (-(으)라고 하다)
Report commands, requests, or suggestions.

**Patterns:**
- Action verbs: -(으)라고 하다
- Negative: -지 말라고 하다

**Shortened Form**: -(으)라고 → -래(요)

**Example**:
- Direct: "공부하세요"
- Reported: 공부하라고 했어요 / 공부하래요

## Key Differences from English

1. **No quotation marks**: Korean smoothly integrates reported speech
2. **Tense in the quote**: Usually matches original tense (unlike English)
3. **Particles adjust**: 저/나, 제/내 change based on perspective
4. **Shortened forms**: Very common in casual speech

## Common Reporting Verbs

While 하다 (to say) is most common, other verbs work too:

- 말하다 (to say, tell)
- 물어보다/묻다 (to ask)
- 대답하다 (to answer)
- 설명하다 (to explain)
- 듣다 (to hear)

## Learning Strategy

1. **Master statements first**: Most common type
2. **Learn shortened forms**: Essential for natural speech
3. **Practice tense conversion**: Keep track of time references
4. **Listen actively**: Notice how natives use reported speech

## Why This Matters

Reported speech is crucial for:

- Gossip and sharing information
- Relaying messages
- Talking about what you heard
- Natural conversation flow
- Understanding Korean media and conversations
