# Passive and Causative Voice

!!! abstract "Quick Reference"
    **Passive Voice** (피동): Subject receives the action

    - **Suffixes**: -이-, -히-, -리-, -기-
    - 보다 → 보이다 (to be seen)
    - 듣다 → 들리다 (to be heard)

    **Causative Voice** (사동): Subject causes someone else to do something

    - **Suffixes**: -이-, -히-, -리-, -기-, -우-, -추-
    - 먹다 → 먹이다 (to feed)
    - 입다 → 입히다 (to dress someone)

## Overview

Korean has two voice transformations that change how actions relate to subjects:

### Passive Voice (피동)

The passive voice shifts focus from the doer to the receiver of an action.

**English comparison:**
- Active: "I opened the door"
- Passive: "The door was opened (by me)"

**Korean:**
- Active: 제가 문을 열었어요
- Passive: 문이 열렸어요

**Formation methods:**

1. **Suffix addition** (most common): -이/히/리/기-
2. **Auxiliary verbs**: -아/어지다, -게 되다

### Causative Voice (사동)

The causative voice indicates that the subject makes or allows someone else to perform an action.

**English comparison:**
- Direct: "The baby ate"
- Causative: "I fed the baby" (I made the baby eat)

**Korean:**
- Direct: 아기가 먹었어요
- Causative: 아기에게 먹였어요

**Formation methods:**

1. **Suffix addition**: -이/히/리/기/우/추-
2. **Auxiliary verbs**: -게 하다

## Key Differences

### Passive vs. Causative

| Type | Focus | Example | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|---------|
| Active | Doer performs action | 보다 | to see |
| Passive | Receiver of action | 보이다 | to be seen |
| Causative | Causing action | 보이다 | to show (make see) |

**Important**: Some verbs look identical but meaning depends on context:

- 보이다 (passive): 별이 보여요 (Stars are visible)
- 보이다 (causative): 사진을 보여요 (I show a photo)

### Identifying Passive vs. Causative

**Passive indicators:**
- Subject is affected by the action
- Often translated with "to be + past participle"
- No agent making someone do something

**Causative indicators:**
- Subject causes someone/something to act
- Often has an indirect object (에게, 한테)
- Translated with "make/let/have someone do"

## Common Patterns

### Overlapping Forms

Some verbs have the same form for both passive and causative:

| Base | Passive/Causative | Passive Meaning | Causative Meaning |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 먹다 | 먹히다 | to be eaten | to be fed |
| 읽다 | 읽히다 | to be read | to make read |
| 신다 | 신기다 | (rare) | to put shoes on someone |

**Context determines meaning:**

1. 이 책이 잘 읽혀요. (Passive - This book reads well)
2. 아이에게 책을 읽혀요. (Causative - I make the child read a book)

### Suffix Selection

No strict rule exists for which suffix to use - it's lexically determined:

**-이-**: 보다 → 보이다, 먹다 → 먹이다, 쌓다 → 쌓이다
**-히-**: 잡다 → 잡히다, 읽다 → 읽히다, 닫다 → 닫히다
**-리-**: 들다 → 들리다, 울다 → 울리다, 열다 → 열리다
**-기-**: 안다 → 안기다, 신다 → 신기다, 벗다 → 벗기다
**-우-**: 자다 → 재우다, 서다 → 세우다 (causative only)
**-추-**: 낮다 → 낮추다, 높다 → 높추다 (causative only)

## Usage Notes

### Passive Voice

**When Koreans use passive:**

1. Focus on the result rather than the doer
2. Formal or written contexts
3. When the agent is unknown or unimportant
4. Natural phenomena or states

**Less common than English:**
- Korean often prefers active constructions
- Where English uses passive, Korean might use active with different subject

### Causative Voice

**Common uses:**

1. Parents with children (feeding, dressing, etc.)
2. Teaching contexts (making students learn)
3. Service contexts (having someone do something)
4. Instructions and commands

## Structure Summary

### Passive Constructions

**With suffixes:**
```
Subject + 이/가 + Passive Verb
문이 열렸어요. (The door opened/was opened.)
```

**With -아/어지다:**
```
Subject + 이/가 + Adjective/Verb stem + 아/어지다
날씨가 추워졌어요. (The weather became cold.)
```

### Causative Constructions

**With suffixes:**
```
Subject + 이/가 + Object + 에게/한테 + Causative Verb
엄마가 아기에게 밥을 먹였어요. (Mom fed the baby.)
```

**With -게 하다:**
```
Subject + 이/가 + Object + 에게/한테 + Verb stem + 게 하다
선생님이 학생들에게 숙제를 하게 했어요. (The teacher made the students do homework.)
```

## Learning Path

1. **Start with**: Common passive/causative pairs (보이다, 들리다, 먹이다)
2. **Practice**: Distinguishing passive from causative in context
3. **Expand**: Learn verb-specific suffix patterns
4. **Master**: Alternative constructions (-아/어지다, -게 하다)
