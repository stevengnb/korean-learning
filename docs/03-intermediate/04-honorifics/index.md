# Korean Honorific System (존댓말)

!!! abstract "Quick Reference"
    **Three main components:**

    1. **Subject Honorifics** (주체 높임): -(으)시- to honor the subject
    2. **Humble Forms** (겸양어): Special verbs to lower yourself
    3. **Honorific Vocabulary** (높임말 어휘): Special nouns for respected persons

    **Core principle**: Raise others, lower yourself

## Overview

The Korean honorific system is a complex grammatical and lexical framework for showing respect based on social hierarchy, age, and formality. Understanding and using honorifics correctly is essential for social interaction in Korean culture.

### Why Honorifics Matter

In Korean society, showing proper respect through language is not optional - it's a fundamental aspect of communication. Using incorrect honorifics can be:

- **Socially awkward** (too casual with superiors)
- **Offensive** (not showing due respect)
- **Overly deferential** (too formal with peers)

### Three Dimensions of Respect

Korean honorifics operate on three levels:

| Type | Function | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Subject Honorific** | Raise the subject | 할머니가 주무세요 (Grandma sleeps) |
| **Object Honorific** | Raise the object | 선생님께 드려요 (I give to teacher) |
| **Addressee Honorific** | Formal ending | -요, -ㅂ니다 |

## Subject Honorifics: -(으)시-

The most common honorific marker, inserted between verb stem and ending.

**Formation:**
- Verb stem + -시- + ending
- 가다 → 가시다 → 가세요 (go - honorific)

**When to use:**
- Subject is someone you respect
- Talking about elders, superiors, customers, strangers
- NOT used when subject is yourself (except royal "we")

**Examples:**

1. 할아버지가 주무세요.
   (Grandfather is sleeping.)

2. 선생님이 오셨어요.
   (The teacher came/has come.)

3. 사장님이 말씀하셨어요.
   (The CEO spoke.)

## Humble Forms (Object Honorifics)

Special verbs used when you (the subject) perform an action for a respected person (the object).

**Key humble verbs:**

| Plain Verb | Humble Form | Meaning |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| 주다 | 드리다 | to give (to respected person) |
| 만나다 | 뵙다 | to meet (respected person) |
| 묻다 | 여쭙다 | to ask (respected person) |
| 데리다 | 모시다 | to accompany (respected person) |
| 있다 | 계시다 | to exist (respected person) |
| 먹다 | 드시다 | to eat (respected person) |

**Examples:**

1. 선생님께 선물을 드렸어요.
   (I gave a gift to my teacher.)

2. 교수님을 내일 뵙겠습니다.
   (I will meet the professor tomorrow.)

3. 부모님께 여쭤봤어요.
   (I asked my parents.)

## Honorific Vocabulary

Special nouns used for respected persons:

| Plain | Honorific | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 밥 | 진지 | meal (for respected person) |
| 나이 | 연세 | age |
| 집 | 댁 | house/home |
| 이름 | 성함 | name |
| 말 | 말씀 | words/speech |
| 생일 | 생신 | birthday |

**Examples:**

1. 진지 드셨어요?
   (Have you eaten? - to elder)

2. 연세가 어떻게 되세요?
   (How old are you? - respectful)

3. 성함이 어떻게 되세요?
   (What is your name? - respectful)

## Social Context and Usage

1. Parents, grandparents, elders
2. Teachers, professors
3. Bosses, superiors at work

### Age and Hierarchy

Korean society is highly age-conscious:

- **Same age** (동갑): Usually casual speech, but context matters
- **1-2 years older**: Often casual if close, honorifics if not
- **3+ years older**: Generally honorifics until invited to be casual
- **10+ years older**: Almost always honorifics

**Workplace hierarchy overrides age:**
- Junior employee → Senior employee: Always honorific
- Even if junior is older by age

### Regional and Generational Differences

**Generational:**
- **Older generation**: Stricter honorific usage
- **Younger generation**: More flexible, especially among friends

**Regional:**
- **Seoul**: More relaxed in casual settings
- **Traditional areas**: Stricter adherence
- **Jeolla**: Known for particularly polite speech

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Using -(으)시- for yourself

**Wrong**: 제가 가셨어요. ❌
**Right**: 제가 갔어요. ✓

### Mistake 2: Not using honorifics with 계시다

**Wrong**: 할머니가 집에 있어요. ❌
**Right**: 할머니께서 집에 계세요. ✓

### Mistake 3: Mixing plain and honorific vocabulary

**Wrong**: 할아버지가 밥을 드셨어요. ❌
**Right**: 할아버지가 진지를 드셨어요. ✓

### Mistake 4: Using humble forms for the subject

**Right**: 선생님이 저한테 주셨어요. ✓

### Mistake 5: Overusing honorifics

Using excessive honorifics can sound awkward or sarcastic:

**Awkward**: 우리 아빠께서 주무시고 계십니다. (Too formal for casual context)
**Better**: 우리 아빠가 주무세요. / 아버지께서 주무세요.

## Particles with Honorifics

Special particles used with respected persons:

| Plain | Honorific | Function |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| 이/가 | 께서 | subject marker |

**Examples:**

1. 선생님께서 오셨어요.
   (The teacher came.)

2. 할아버지께 말씀드렸어요.
   (I spoke to grandfather.)

## Levels of Formality

Korean has multiple formality levels:

| Level | Ending | Context |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Formal polite | -ㅂ니다/습니다 | Business, presentations, news |
| Informal polite | -아/어요 | Most common polite speech |
| Formal casual | -네, -ㄴ/는다 | Written, formal casual |
| Informal casual | -아/어 | Friends, younger people |

**Honorifics can combine with any level:**

- 할머니가 가십니다. (Formal polite + honorific)
- 할머니가 가세요. (Informal polite + honorific)
- 할머니가 가셔. (Informal casual + honorific - rare but possible)
