# Idiomatic Expressions

Korean idiomatic expressions (관용어) are phrases whose meanings can't be understood from the literal meanings of individual words. Like English "it's raining cats and dogs," Korean has its own colorful, culturally rich idioms.

## What Are Idioms?

**Idioms are:**
- Fixed phrases with figurative meanings
- Culturally specific expressions
- Often metaphorical
- Not translatable word-for-word

**Examples:**
```
눈이 높다 (eyes are high)
→ Literal: eyes are high
→ Actual: have high standards, be picky

발이 넓다 (feet are wide)
→ Literal: feet are wide
→ Actual: have many connections, be well-connected
```
