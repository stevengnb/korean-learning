## Cultural Note

### Information Sourcing

Korean culture values knowing where information comes from:

- **Hearsay patterns** show you're not claiming direct knowledge
- Shows **humility** (not claiming to know everything)
- Shows **responsibility** (distinguishing fact from rumor)
- Creates **social connection** (sharing what you heard invites discussion)

### Gossip Culture

These patterns are essential for:
- Sharing news in social groups
- Making indirect suggestions
- Avoiding direct recommendations (if it turns out to be wrong, you're just reporting what you heard)

### Professional Use

In business:
- **-다고 들었습니다** maintains professionalism
- Shows you verified information
- Allows for correction if information is wrong
- More careful than stating as fact

**Example comparison:**
```
내일 회의가 있어요. (stating as fact)
내일 회의가 있다고 들었어요. (reporting, more careful)
```

The second version protects you if you're wrong and sounds more humble.

Use these patterns frequently—they're essential for natural Korean communication!
