## Additional Patterns

### -ㄹ까 봐 (worried that...)

Related but different meaning:

```
늦을까 봐 일찍 출발했어요.

```

### -기로 했으니까 (since I decided...)

Used for explaining actions:

```
운동하기로 했으니까 지금 가야 해요.
Since I decided to exercise, I need to go now.
```

### 생각 없다 (no intention)

Very useful for firm refusals:

```
A: 같이 갈래?
B: 아니요, 갈 생각 없어요.
```

## Common Mistakes

**1. Using -기로 하다 for tentative plans:**
```
❌ 저녁에 뭐 먹기로 해요? (too firm for casual question)
✓ 저녁에 뭐 먹을까 해요?
```

**2. Using -ㄹ까 하다 for firm commitments:**
```
❌ 내일 꼭 갈까 해요. (contradictory: 꼭 but tentative)
✓ 내일 꼭 가기로 했어요.
```

**3. Confusing -ㄹ 생각 없다 with -지 않을 생각이다:**
```
✓ 갈 생각이 없어요. (natural: no intention)
❌ 안 갈 생각이에요. (awkward)
```

## Natural Usage Tips

1. **Use -ㄹ까 해요** when seeking input or approval
2. **Use -기로 했어요** when announcing firm decisions
3. **Use -ㄹ 생각이에요** when sharing personal plans
4. **Soften -기로 하다** with 일단: 일단 가기로 했어요 (for now, decided to go)
5. **Add 그냥** to -ㄹ까 하다** for casualness: 그냥 집에 있을까 해요

## Cultural Note

Korean communication values:
- **Flexibility**: -ㄹ까 하다 shows you're open to others' opinions
- **Commitment**: -기로 하다 shows reliability when used
- **Personal agency**: -ㄹ 생각이다 shows your independent thinking

Use the appropriate level based on:
- How firm your decision is
- Whether others are involved
- How much flexibility you want to show
- Social context and relationship

In professional settings, -기로 했습니다 shows commitment and responsibility. In casual settings, -ㄹ까 해요 sounds more friendly and open to discussion.
