# Regret & Hindsight

## Quick Reference

| Pattern | Meaning | Tone | Example |
|---------|---------|------|---------|
| **-ㄹ 걸 (그랬다)** | Should have... | Regret, wishing | 갈 걸 (그랬어) |
| **-았/었어야 했는데** | Should have... | Obligation not met | 갔어야 했는데 |

## -ㄹ 걸 (그랬다) (I should have...)

### Formation

**All verbs:**
- Add **-ㄹ 걸** after vowel stems: 가다 → 갈 걸
- Add **-을 걸** after consonant stems: 먹다 → 먹을 걸

**Common forms:**
- 갈 걸 (그랬어)
- 갈 걸 (short form)
- 갈 걸 (그랬어요) (polite)

**Negative:**
- 안 갈 걸 (그랬어) - "I shouldn't have gone"
- 가지 말 걸 (그랬어) - "I shouldn't have gone"

### Usage

Express regret or wishing you had done something differently. The 그랬다 part is often omitted in speech:

**Examples:**
```
더 일찍 일어날 걸 그랬어.
I should have woken up earlier. (regretting)

그 영화를 볼 걸.
I should have watched that movie.

우산을 가져올 걸 그랬어요.
I should have brought an umbrella.

진작 말할 걸.
I should have said so earlier.

커피를 안 마실 걸.
I shouldn't have drunk coffee.

그 옷을 살 걸 그랬어요.
I should have bought those clothes.
```

### Emotional Tone

This pattern carries strong emotional weight:
- Personal regret
- Wishing you could change the past
- Often said with a sigh
- Less about obligation, more about wishing

### Common Scenarios

**Missing opportunities:**
```
그때 고백할 걸 그랬어.
I should have confessed then.
```

**Wrong choices:**
```
다른 거 주문할 걸.
I should have ordered something else.
```

**Not acting:**
```
더 열심히 공부할 걸 그랬어.
I should have studied harder.
```

## -았/었어야 했는데 (Should have...)

### Formation

**Past tense + 어야 했는데:**
- 가다 → 갔어야 했는데
- 먹다 → 먹었어야 했는데
- 하다 → 했어야 했는데

**Negative:**
- 안 갔어야 했는데 - "shouldn't have gone"
- 가지 말았어야 했는데 - "shouldn't have gone"

### Usage

Express that you failed to meet an obligation or expectation. Stronger sense of duty than -ㄹ 걸:

**Examples:**
```
미리 전화했어야 했는데.
I should have called in advance.

숙제를 했어야 했는데.
I should have done my homework.

회의에 갔어야 했는데.
I should have gone to the meeting.

더 조심했어야 했는데요.
I should have been more careful.

일찍 출발했어야 했는데.
We should have left earlier.
```

### Usage Context

This pattern emphasizes:
- Responsibility or obligation
- Something you were supposed to do
- Often used when explaining/apologizing
- More serious tone than -ㄹ 걸

### Common Patterns

**With apologies:**
```
미안해요. 전화했어야 했는데.
I'm sorry. I should have called.
```

**Explaining consequences:**
```
미리 예약했어야 했는데 자리가 없어요.
We should have reserved in advance, but there are no seats.
```

**Self-reproach:**
```
더 잘했어야 했는데.
I should have done better.
```

## Key Differences

### -ㄹ 걸 (그랬다)
- **Emotion**: Personal regret, wishing
- **Focus**: "I wish I had..."
- **Tone**: Softer, more emotional
- **Context**: Personal desires and wishes

**Example:**
```
그 케이크를 살 걸.
I wish I had bought that cake. (personal regret)
```

### -았/었어야 했는데
- **Emotion**: Failed obligation
- **Focus**: "I was supposed to..."
- **Tone**: Stronger, more serious
- **Context**: Responsibilities and duties

**Example:**
```
그 케이크를 샀어야 했는데.
I should have bought that cake. (it was my responsibility)
```

## Combined Usage

Sometimes both can work, with different nuances:

```
약속 시간에 맞춰 갈 걸 그랬어.
I wish I had arrived on time. (personal regret)

약속 시간에 맞춰 갔어야 했는데.
I should have arrived on time. (I had an obligation)
```

## Additional Patterns

### -ㄹ 걸 그랬어요? (Suggestion with regret)

Used to suggest something to someone else, implying they should have done it:

```
더 일찍 올 걸 그랬어요.
You should have come earlier.

물어볼 걸 그랬어요.
You should have asked.
```

### Intensifying with 진작

**진작** = "much earlier, long ago"

```
진작 할 걸 그랬어.
I should have done it much earlier.

진작 말했어야 했는데.
I should have said so long ago.
```

## Common Mistakes

**1. Using wrong tense with -어야 했는데:**
```
❌ 가야 했는데 (present tense)
✓ 갔어야 했는데 (past tense)
```

**2. Forgetting 그랬다 context with -ㄹ 걸:**
```
The 그랬다/그랬어 can be omitted, but understand it's implied:
갈 걸 = 갈 걸 그랬어
```

**3. Using -ㄹ 걸 for others' obligations:**
```
❌ 네가 할 걸 그랬어. (awkward)
✓ 네가 했어야 했어. (correct for others)
✓ 할 걸 그랬어. (only for yourself)
```

## Natural Usage Tips

1. **Add 그랬어요** in full sentences for emphasis
2. **Omit 그랬어** in casual speech: just say 갈 걸...
3. **Use 진작** for stronger regret about timing
4. **Combine with 미안해요** when apologizing
5. **Sigh or use hesitant tone** for emotional effect

## Cultural Note

Korean culture values humility and self-reflection. These regret patterns are used frequently, even for small things:

```
물 한 잔 더 마실 걸. (I should have drunk more water)
점심 뭐 먹지? 김치찌개 먹을 걸 그랬어. (What should we eat? I should have had kimchi stew)
```

Using these patterns shows:
- Self-awareness
- Willingness to admit mistakes
- Reflective thinking
- Emotional honesty

Don't overuse, but don't be afraid to express regret when appropriate—it's natural and expected in Korean communication.
