## Cultural Note

### When to Use Slang

**Safe contexts:**
- Close friends same age
- Casual group chat
- Reacting to media/content
- Informal social situations

**Risky contexts:**
- Anyone older (even by 1-2 years)
- Workplace
- School with teachers
- First meetings

### Age Sensitivity

Korean age hierarchy is strict:
- Even 1 year difference can matter
- Slang with 오빠/언니 might be okay if very close
- Never with 선배 unless invited
- Absolutely never with elders or superiors

### Regional Variations

Seoul vs. Busan vs. other regions have different slang. As a learner, stick to standard Seoul slang you hear in mainstream media.

## Learning Resources

**To stay current:**
- Korean variety shows
- K-drama (recent ones)
- Korean YouTubers
- Korean social media (Instagram, Twitter/X)
- Webtoon comments sections
- Ask Korean friends!

**Warning signs slang is outdated:**
- Parents using it
- Not hearing it in recent media
- Koreans laugh when you use it
- Feels forced in conversation

Use slang sparingly until you're confident in contexts and timing. It's better to sound slightly formal than to misuse slang inappropriately!
