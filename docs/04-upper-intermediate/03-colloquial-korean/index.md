# Colloquial Korean

Colloquial Korean is the casual, everyday language spoken by native speakers in informal settings. It differs significantly from textbook Korean through contractions, slang, shortcuts, and natural speech patterns.

## Why Learn Colloquial Korean?

**Understanding native speakers:**
- K-dramas and variety shows
- Casual conversations with friends
- Social media and text messages
- YouTube videos and podcasts

**Sounding natural:**
- Less textbook, more authentic
- Building rapport with native speakers
- Understanding cultural references
- Fitting in socially

## Key Features of Colloquial Korean

### Contractions
Shortening words and phrases for speed and naturalness:
- 뭐 해? (what doing?) instead of 무엇을 해?
- 왔어 (came) instead of 왔어요

### Slang
Generation-specific and trendy language:
- 대박 (awesome, jackpot)
- 헐 (OMG, what?!)
- 쩐다 (amazing, intense)

### Texting Language
Digital communication shortcuts:
- ㅋㅋ (laughter)
- ㅇㅇ (yes, yeah)
- ㄴㄴ (no, nope)

### Filler Words
Natural hesitations and speech markers:
- 음... (um...)
- 그... (uh...)
- 뭐랄까... (how should I say...)

## Formality Spectrum

**Most Formal:**
합니다체 → 해요체 → 반말 (casual) → 슬랭 (slang)
**Least Formal**

Colloquial Korean lives in the 반말 and 슬랭 zones.

## When to Use Colloquial Korean

### Appropriate:
- Close friends (same age or younger)
- Family members (depending on relationship)
- Online gaming and social media
- Text messages to friends
- Casual social situations

### Not appropriate:
- Workplace (unless very casual company)
- Strangers
- Anyone older than you (unless they explicitly say it's okay)
- Formal situations

## Warning: Age and Hierarchy Matter

Korean is highly sensitive to social relationships. Using colloquial language with the wrong person can be:
- Disrespectful
- Offensive
- Socially damaging

**Safe rule:** Wait for the other person to use casual language first, or ask permission:
```
반말해도 돼요?
Is it okay to use casual language?
```
