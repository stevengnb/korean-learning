### Formality in Digital Communication

Even in texting, hierarchy matters:

```

**To seniors/professors:**
```
네 괜찮습니다 ^^
Yes, I'm fine ^^
```

Notice: full words + polite endings even in text

### Reading Comprehension vs. Production

**As a learner:**
1. **Understand** most abbreviations (for reading)
2. **Use** only safe, common ones (ㅋㅋ, ㅎㅎ, ^^, ㅇㅇ)
3. **Avoid** vulgar or very casual ones until confident
4. **Match** the style of the person you're texting

The safest approach: slightly more formal than too casual.

Master texting language to understand Korean digital communication, but use conservatively until you're sure of appropriateness!
