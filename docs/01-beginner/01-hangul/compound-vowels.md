## Detailed Explanation

Compound vowels (복합모음 or 이중모음) are formed by combining two basic vowels. While historically these represented diphthongs (two vowel sounds gliding together), in modern Korean many are pronounced as single vowel sounds.

### Simple Compounds (단순 복합모음)

These are combinations that create a single vowel sound:

#### ㅐ - ae sound
- **Formation**: ㅏ + ㅣ (visually side by side)
- **Historical sound**: "a" + "i" diphthong
- **Modern sound**: Like 'a' in "cat" or 'e' in "bed"
- **Note**: In modern Seoul Korean, often indistinguishable from ㅔ
- **Examples**: 애기 (baby), 사과 → 개 (dog), 태양 (sun)

#### ㅒ - yae sound
- **Formation**: ㅑ + ㅣ
- **Sound**: 'y' + ㅐ sound
- **Note**: Less common than ㅐ
- **Examples**: 얘기 (story/talk), 걔 (that kid), 얘 (this kid)

#### ㅔ - e sound
- **Formation**: ㅓ + ㅣ (visually side by side)
- **Historical sound**: "eo" + "i" diphthong
- **Modern sound**: Like 'e' in "bed"
- **Note**: In modern Seoul Korean, often indistinguishable from ㅐ
- **Examples**: 에어컨 (air conditioner), 세계 (world), 네 (yes)

#### ㅖ - ye sound
- **Formation**: ㅕ + ㅣ
- **Sound**: 'y' + ㅔ sound
- **Examples**: 예 (yes/example), 예쁘다 (to be pretty), 계절 (season)

### ㅐ vs ㅔ Pronunciation

**Historical distinction:**
- ㅐ was pronounced with mouth more open (like 'a' in "cat")
- ㅔ was pronounced with mouth less open (like 'e' in "bed")

**Modern reality:**
- Most Korean speakers pronounce them identically as 'e'
- Older speakers and some dialects maintain the distinction
- In listening, context determines which is meant
- In writing, you must memorize which spelling is correct

### W-Vowels (와 계열)

These start with a 'w' sound from combining with ㅗ or ㅜ:

#### ㅘ - wa sound
- **Formation**: ㅗ + ㅏ
- **Sound**: Like 'wa' in "wander"
- **Examples**: 과자 (snack), 왕 (king), 과일 (fruit)

#### ㅙ - wae sound
- **Formation**: ㅗ + ㅐ (or ㅗ + ㅏ + ㅣ)
- **Sound**: 'w' + ㅐ sound
- **Note**: Less common
- **Examples**: 왜 (why), 돼지 (pig), 왜곡 (distortion)

#### ㅚ - oe/we sound
- **Formation**: ㅗ + ㅣ
- **Historical sound**: Pure 'ö' sound (like German ö)
- **Modern sound**: Often pronounced like 'we' or 'weh'
- **Regional variation**: Some speakers pronounce as ㅞ (we), others as single vowel
- **Examples**: 외국 (foreign country), 되다 (to become), 회사 (company)

#### ㅝ - weo sound
- **Formation**: ㅜ + ㅓ
- **Sound**: Like 'wo' in "won't"
- **Examples**: 원 (won/circle), 월 (month), 워 (whoa - interjection)

#### ㅞ - we sound
- **Formation**: ㅜ + ㅔ (or ㅜ + ㅓ + ㅣ)
- **Sound**: 'w' + ㅔ sound
- **Note**: Rare in common words
- **Examples**: 웨딩 (wedding), 스웨터 (sweater), 웨이터 (waiter)

#### ㅟ - wi sound
- **Formation**: ㅜ + ㅣ
- **Historical sound**: Pure 'ü' sound (like German ü)
- **Modern sound**: Often pronounced like ㅣ (just "ee")
- **Examples**: 위 (top/above/stomach), 쥐 (mouse), 귀 (ear)

### Special Case: ㅢ

#### ㅢ - ui/eui sound
- **Formation**: ㅡ + ㅣ
- **Complexity**: Three different pronunciations depending on position!

**Position rules:**

| Position | Pronunciation | Example | Meaning |
|----------|---------------|---------|---------|
| First syllable | [ui] or [ɯi] | 의사 [ui-sa] | doctor |
| After consonant | [i] | 희망 [hi-mang] | hope |
| Possessive particle | [e] | 나의 [na-e] | my/mine |

**Additional examples:**
- 의미 (meaning) - [ui-mi]
- 주의 (caution) - [ju-i]
- 우리의 (our) - [u-ri-e]
- 희다 (to be white) - [hi-da]

This is the most complex vowel in Korean pronunciation!

## Syllable Formation with Compound Vowels

### Vertical Compounds (ㅐ, ㅒ, ㅔ, ㅖ, ㅢ)

### Complex Compounds (ㅘ, ㅙ, ㅚ, ㅝ, ㅞ, ㅟ)
Written below the consonant (occupy more space):

| Syllable | Breakdown | Example Word | Meaning |
|----------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| 과 | ㄱ + ㅘ | 과일 | fruit |
| 왜 | ㅇ + ㅙ | 왜 | why |
| 외 | ㅇ + ㅚ | 외국 | foreign country |

## Memory Tips

### Visual Grouping
Think of compound vowels as combinations:

**ㅣ-based** (add ㅣ to basic vowel):
- ㅏ + ㅣ = ㅐ
- ㅓ + ㅣ = ㅔ
- ㅗ + ㅣ = ㅚ
- ㅜ + ㅣ = ㅟ
- ㅡ + ㅣ = ㅢ

**W-based** (combine ㅗ or ㅜ with another vowel):
- ㅗ + ㅏ = ㅘ
- ㅗ + ㅐ = ㅙ
- ㅜ + ㅓ = ㅝ
- ㅜ + ㅔ = ㅞ

**Y-versions** (add y-sound):
- ㅐ → ㅒ (yae)
- ㅔ → ㅖ (ye)
