# Double Consonants (Tense Consonants)

!!! abstract "Quick Reference"
    **5 Double Consonants (경음/쌍자음)** - Created by doubling basic consonants:

    | Basic | Double | Sound Change | Example Word |
    |-------|--------|--------------|--------------|
    | ㄱ | ㄲ | k → hard k | 까다 (to peel) |
    | ㄷ | ㄸ | t/d → hard t | 따다 (to pick) |
    | ㅂ | ㅃ | p/b → hard p | 빠다 (to suck) |
    | ㅅ | ㅆ | s → hard s | 싸다 (to wrap/to be cheap) |
    | ㅈ | ㅉ | j → hard j | 짜다 (to squeeze/to be salty) |

## Detailed Explanation

Double consonants (쌍자음), also called **tense consonants** (경음), are pronounced with more tension in the throat and without aspiration. They are formed by simply doubling the basic consonant.

### What Makes Them "Tense"?

**Physical characteristics:**
1. **Glottal tension**: The throat muscles tighten
2. **No aspiration**: No puff of air (unlike ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ, ㅊ)
3. **Shorter, sharper sound**: More forceful articulation
4. **Higher pitch**: Often pronounced with slightly higher pitch

**Testing aspiration:**
- Hold your hand in front of your mouth
- **ㄱ**: Small puff of air
- **ㅋ**: Large puff of air
- **ㄲ**: No puff of air

## When Double Consonants Appear

### Initial Position
Most common position for double consonants:
- 까다 (to peel)
- 빵 (bread)
- 쌀 (rice)

### After Final Consonant (Sound Change)
Double consonants can appear through sound changes (경음화):
- 학교 → [학꾜] (school)
- 잡지 → [잡찌] (magazine)
- 국가 → [국까] (nation)

(More details in [Sound Changes](sound-changes.md))

### Never in Final Position
Double consonants **never** appear as final consonants (받침). Only single consonants can be final consonants.

## Writing Double Consonants

**Important rules:**
1. Write them as two separate but close letters: ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ
2. They occupy the same space as a single consonant in the syllable block
3. In vertical vowel syllables: Double consonant on left, vowel on right (까, 빠)
4. In horizontal vowel syllables: Double consonant on top, vowel below (꼬, 뿌)

**Examples:**
- 까 = ㄲ + ㅏ (not ㄱㄱ + ㅏ)
- 빵 = ㅃ + ㅏ + ㅇ
- 쌀 = ㅆ + ㅏ + ㄹ
