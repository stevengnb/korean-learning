# Introduction to Hangul

!!! abstract "Quick Reference"
    **한글 (Hangul)** is the Korean alphabet, created in 1443 by King Sejong the Great. It is one of the most scientific and logical writing systems in the world.

    - **24 basic letters**: 14 consonants + 10 vowels
    - **Syllable blocks**: Characters combine into blocks (e.g., 한 = ㅎ + ㅏ + ㄴ)
    - **Learning order**: Basic consonants → Basic vowels → Syllable formation → Compound vowels → Double consonants → Final consonants → Sound changes

## Why Learn Hangul?

Hangul is essential for Korean learning because:

1. **Phonetic accuracy**: Unlike romanization, Hangul represents Korean sounds precisely
2. **Reading real Korean**: All Korean media, signs, and materials use Hangul
3. **Quick to learn**: Most learners can read basic Hangul in 1-2 days
4. **Foundation for pronunciation**: Understanding Hangul helps with proper pronunciation
5. **Pattern recognition**: Korean grammar patterns are easier to recognize in Hangul

## The Structure of Hangul

### Syllable Blocks

Unlike English where letters are written in a line, Korean characters are arranged in **syllable blocks**. Each block represents one syllable and contains 2-4 letters.

**Basic patterns:**

| Pattern | Structure | Example | Meaning |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| CV | Consonant + Vowel | 가 (ㄱ + ㅏ) | to go |
| CVC | Consonant + Vowel + Consonant | 강 (ㄱ + ㅏ + ㅇ) | river |
| CCV | Consonant + Compound Vowel | 개 (ㄱ + ㅐ) | dog |
| CCVC | Consonant + Compound Vowel + Consonant | 공 (ㄱ + ㅗ + ㅇ) | ball |

### The 24 Basic Letters

**14 Basic Consonants:**
ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ

**10 Basic Vowels:**
ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ

**Additional Letters (formed from basics):**
- 11 compound vowels
- 5 double (tense) consonants
- 27 possible final consonants (받침)

## Recommended Learning Order

Follow this order for the most effective learning:

1. **Basic Consonants** - Learn the 14 fundamental consonant sounds
2. **Basic Vowels** - Master the 10 basic vowel sounds
3. **Simple Syllables** - Practice combining consonants and vowels
4. **Compound Vowels** - Learn the 11 compound vowel sounds
5. **Double Consonants** - Understand tense consonant sounds
6. **Final Consonants (받침)** - Learn how consonants sound at the end of syllables
7. **Sound Changes** - Master pronunciation rules for natural speech

## Historical Context

King Sejong the Great created Hangul in 1443 (promulgated in 1446) because:

- Chinese characters (한자) were difficult for common people to learn
- He wanted all Korean people to be able to read and write
- The alphabet was designed based on the physical shape of the mouth when making sounds

Originally called **훈민정음** (Hunminjeongeum, "Proper Sounds for Instructing the People"), Hangul is now celebrated annually on **한글날** (Hangul Day) - October 9th in South Korea.

## Key Principles

### 1. Featural Alphabet
Hangul is a **featural alphabet** - the shapes of the letters are based on the articulatory features of the sounds:

- **ㄱ, ㄴ, ㅁ, ㅅ, ㅇ** - Basic consonants shaped after tongue/mouth position
- **ㅋ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅈ, ㅎ** - Derived by adding strokes (indicating stronger aspiration)
- **ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ** - Doubled for tense sounds

### 2. Systematic Vowel System
Vowels are based on three elements:

- **· (heaven/dot)** - represented in ㅗ, ㅛ, ㅜ, ㅠ
- **ㅡ (earth/horizontal line)** - the vowel ㅡ itself
- **ㅣ (human/vertical line)** - the vowel ㅣ itself

All other vowels are combinations of these elements.

### 3. Syllable Block Logic
Each syllable block must:

- Start with a consonant (use ㅇ as a silent placeholder if the syllable starts with a vowel sound)
- Contain exactly one vowel (basic or compound)
- Optionally end with a consonant (받침)

## Practice

1. How many basic consonants are in Hangul?
2. How many basic vowels are in Hangul?
3. What is the shape of a syllable that has a consonant, vowel, and final consonant?
4. Which character is used as a silent placeholder when a syllable starts with a vowel sound?
5. In what year was Hangul created?
6. What was the original name of Hangul?
7. Can you write a syllable block with only a vowel (without any consonant)?
8. What are the three elements that form the vowel system?
9. How are tense consonants formed visually?
10. Why did King Sejong create Hangul?

1. 14 basic consonants
2. 10 basic vowels
3. CVC pattern (Consonant + Vowel + Consonant), example: 강
4. ㅇ (circle) - it is silent in initial position
5. 1443 (promulgated in 1446)
6. 훈민정음 (Hunminjeongeum)
7. No - every syllable block must start with a consonant. Use ㅇ as a placeholder for vowel-initial syllables (e.g., 아 = ㅇ + ㅏ)
8. · (dot/heaven), ㅡ (horizontal line/earth), ㅣ (vertical line/human)
9. By doubling the basic consonant (e.g., ㄱ → ㄲ, ㅂ → ㅃ)
10. To create an easy-to-learn writing system for common people who couldn't learn Chinese characters
