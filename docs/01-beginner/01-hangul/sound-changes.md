# Sound Changes (음운 변화)

!!! abstract "Quick Reference"
    **Major Sound Change Rules** in Korean:

    | Rule | Korean Name | Description | Example |
    |------|-------------|-------------|---------|
    | **Liaison** | 연음 | Final consonant moves to next syllable | 옷이 → [오시] |
    | **Nasalization** | 비음화 | Consonants become nasal sounds | 국물 → [궁물] |
    | **Tensification** | 경음화 | Plain consonants become tense | 학교 → [학꾜] |
    | **Aspiration** | 격음화 | Consonants become aspirated | 좋다 → [조타] |
    | **ㅎ Deletion** | ㅎ 탈락 | ㅎ disappears between vowels | 좋아 → [조아] |

## Detailed Explanation

Korean pronunciation follows systematic rules that often differ from how words are written. These **sound changes** (음운 변화) make Korean sound natural and fluid. Understanding them is crucial for:

1. **Natural pronunciation**: Sounding like a native speaker
2. **Listening comprehension**: Understanding spoken Korean
3. **Reading fluency**: Knowing how to pronounce written text correctly

### Why Sound Changes Occur

Sound changes happen to make speech easier and more efficient:
- **Ease of articulation**: Reducing effort required to pronounce sounds
- **Flow**: Making transitions between syllables smoother
- **Efficiency**: Eliminating unnecessary movements

## 1. Liaison (연음 / Resyllabification)

**Rule**: When a syllable ending in a consonant is followed by a syllable starting with ㅇ (silent placeholder), the final consonant moves to the next syllable.

### Basic Pattern

```
받침 + ㅇ vowel → 받침 moves to next syllable
```

### Examples

| Written | Pronounced | Meaning |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 옷이 | [오시] | clothes (subject) |
| 밥을 | [바블] | rice (object) |
| 책을 | [채글] | book (object) |
| 꽃이 | [꼬치] | flower (subject) |
| 없어요 | [업서요] | there isn't |
| 좋아요 | [조아요] | it's good |
| 많이 | [마니] | a lot |
| 읽어요 | [일거요] | to read (polite) |

### With Double Batchim

When double batchim meets ㅇ, both consonants may be pronounced across syllables:

| Written | Pronounced | Explanation | Meaning |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------|
| 닭이 | [달기] | ㄹ stays, ㄱ moves | chicken (subject) |
| 값을 | [갑슬] | ㅂ moves, ㅅ → ㄷ → [ㅅ] | price (object) |
| 읽어 | [일거] | ㄹ stays, ㄱ moves | to read |
| 없어 | [업서] | ㅂ moves, ㅅ moves | to not exist |
| 앉아 | [안자] | ㄴ stays, ㅈ moves | to sit |

### Common Particles Affected

Liaison happens frequently with particles:

| Particle | Example | Pronunciation |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| 이/가 (subject) | 집이 | [지비] |
| 을/를 (object) | 물을 | [무를] |
| 은/는 (topic) | 산은 | [사는] |
| 에 (location) | 집에 | [지베] |
| 에서 (at/from) | 학교에서 | [학교에서] |

## 2. Nasalization (비음화)

**Rule**: When certain consonants are followed by nasal sounds (ㄴ, ㅁ), they become nasal consonants themselves.

### Pattern 1: ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ + ㄴ/ㅁ

| Before Nasal | Becomes | Example | Pronunciation | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|---------|---------------|---------|
| ㄱ + ㄴ/ㅁ | ㅇ + ㄴ/ㅁ | 국물 | [궁물] | soup |
| ㄷ + ㄴ/ㅁ | ㄴ + ㄴ/ㅁ | 받는다 | [반는다] | to receive |
| ㅂ + ㄴ/ㅁ | ㅁ + ㄴ/ㅁ | 밥물 | [밤물] | rice water |

### Detailed Examples

**ㄱ → ㅇ before ㄴ/ㅁ:**
- 국물 [궁물] (soup)
- 학문 [항문] (learning)
- 작년 [장년] (last year)

**ㄷ → ㄴ before ㄴ/ㅁ:**
- 받는다 [반는다] (receives)
- 듣는다 [든는다] (listens)
- 묻는다 [문는다] (asks)

**ㅂ → ㅁ before ㄴ/ㅁ:**
- 밥물 [밤물] (rice water)
- 십년 [심년] (ten years)
- 앞문 [암문] (front door)

### Pattern 2: ㄴ Addition (ㄴ 첨가)

When ㄹ is followed by ㅣ or y-sound, ㄴ is inserted:

| Written | Pronounced | Meaning |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 솔잎 | [솔닙] | pine needle |
| 물약 | [물냑] | liquid medicine |
| 말이다 | [마리다] | it is a horse |

### Pattern 3: ㄹ Nasalization

**ㄹ + ㄴ → ㄹㄹ:**
- 설날 [설랄] → [설날] (New Year's Day)
- 물난리 [물날리] (flood)

**ㄴ + ㄹ → ㄹㄹ:**
- 신라 [실라] (Silla Dynasty)
- 천리 [철리] (thousand ri)

## 3. Tensification (경음화 / Fortis)

**Rule**: Plain consonants (ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅅ, ㅈ) become tense (ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ) in certain environments.

### Pattern 1: After Obstruents

When following ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ final consonants:

| Written | Pronounced | Meaning |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 학교 | [학꾜] | school |
| 국가 | [국까] | nation |
| 책가방 | [책까방] | school bag |
| 밥그릇 | [밥끄릇] | rice bowl |
| 꽃다발 | [꼳따발] | flower bouquet |
| 있다 | [읻따] | to exist |

### Pattern 2: After ㄹ Batchim

| Written | Pronounced | Meaning |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 갈비 | [갈삐] | ribs |
| 물고기 | [물꼬기] | fish |
| 할까 | [할까] | shall we? |
| 불고기 | [불꼬기] | bulgogi |

### Pattern 3: In Compound Words

| Written | Pronounced | Meaning |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 물건 | [물껀] | item/thing |
| 발바닥 | [발빠닥] | sole of foot |
| 손가락 | [손까락] | finger |
| 눈동자 | [눈똥자] | pupil (eye) |

### Pattern 4: With Sino-Korean Numbers

| Written | Pronounced | Meaning |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 일시 | [일씨] | date and time |
| 십분 | [십뿐] | ten minutes |
| 삼십 | [삼십] | thirty |
| 육십 | [육씹] | sixty |

## 4. Aspiration (격음화)

**Rule**: When ㅎ combines with ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅈ, they merge into aspirated consonants ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ, ㅊ.

### Pattern 1: Final ㅎ + Initial ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅈ

| Combination | Result | Example | Pronunciation | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|---------------|---------|
| ㅎ + ㄱ | ㅋ | 좋고 | [조코] | good and |
| ㅎ + ㄷ | ㅌ | 놓다 | [노타] | to put |
| ㅎ + ㅈ | ㅊ | 좋지 | [조치] | isn't it good |

### Pattern 2: Final ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅈ + Initial ㅎ

| Combination | Result | Example | Pronunciation | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|---------------|---------|
| ㄱ + ㅎ | ㅋ | 백화점 | [배콰점] | department store |
| ㄷ + ㅎ | ㅌ | 맏형 | [마텅] | eldest brother |
| ㅂ + ㅎ | ㅍ | 입학 | [이팍] | entrance (to school) |

### Common Examples

| 놓다 | [노타] | to put |
| 쌓다 | [싸타] | to pile up |
| 쌓이다 | [싸치다] | to be piled |
| 입학 | [이팍] | school entrance |
| 축하 | [추카] | congratulations |

## 5. ㅎ Deletion (ㅎ 탈락)

**Rule**: ㅎ often disappears between vowels or in certain consonant combinations.

### Pattern 1: ㅎ Between Vowels

| Written | Pronounced | Meaning |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 좋아 | [조아] | it's good |
| 싫어 | [시러] | I dislike |
| 많아 | [마나] | there are many |
| 놓아 | [노아] | put (it) |

### Pattern 2: ㅎ + ㄴ, ㅁ

When ㅎ meets ㄴ or ㅁ, ㅎ is deleted but may nasalize the preceding consonant:

| Written | Pronounced | Meaning |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 좋네요 | [존네요] | it's good (exclamation) |
| 많네요 | [만네요] | there are many |
| 싫면 | [실면] | if you dislike |

### Pattern 3: ㅎ + ㄹ

| Written | Pronounced | Meaning |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 놓려고 | [노려고] | intending to put |
| 쌓려고 | [싸려고] | intending to pile |

## Combined Sound Changes

Often multiple sound changes happen in sequence:

### Example 1: 학교에서 (at school)

1. Written: 학교에서
2. No change before: [학교에서]
3. Tensification: 학교 → [학꾜]
4. Final: [학꾜에서]

### Example 2: 없는데 (there isn't but...)

1. Written: 없는데
2. First consonant: ㅄ → [ㅂ] in final position
3. Nasalization: ㅂ + ㄴ → [ㅁㄴ]
4. Final: [엄는데]

### Example 3: 좋아요 (it's good)

1. Written: 좋아요
2. ㅎ deletion: ㅎ disappears between vowels
3. Liaison: ㅈ moves to next syllable
4. Final: [조아요]

### Example 4: 읽는다 (to read)

1. Written: 읽는다
2. Double batchim: ㄹㄱ → [ㄱ] in final position
3. Nasalization: ㄱ + ㄴ → [ㅇㄴ]
4. Final: [잉는다]

## Sound Change Priority

When multiple rules could apply, follow this priority:

1. **Liaison (연음)** - happens first
2. **Nasalization (비음화)** - if nasal sound follows
3. **Tensification (경음화)** - if conditions met
4. **Aspiration (격음화)** - if ㅎ is involved
5. **ㅎ deletion (ㅎ 탈락)** - between vowels

## Practice

2. What sound change occurs in 국물 (soup)?
3. Pronounce 학교 (school) correctly.
4. What happens to ㅎ in 좋아 (it's good)?

## Summary

Understanding sound changes is essential for:

- **Speaking naturally**: Making your Korean sound authentic
- **Listening comprehension**: Recognizing words in natural speech
- **Reading aloud**: Pronouncing written text correctly
- **Spelling**: Understanding why words are spelled certain ways

**Key takeaway**: Korean is **not** pronounced exactly as written. Sound changes make the language flow naturally and are systematic and predictable once you learn the rules.
