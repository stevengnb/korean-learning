## Detailed Explanation

**받침 (batchim)** literally means "supporting platform" - it refers to the consonant(s) that appear at the bottom of a syllable block, supporting the syllable structure.

### Why Batchim Matters

1. **Syllable completion**: Korean syllables can end with a consonant
2. **Sound changes**: Batchim triggers various pronunciation rules
3. **Conjugation**: Verb/adjective stems ending in batchim conjugate differently
4. **Rhythm**: Closed syllables (with batchim) vs open syllables affect Korean rhythm

### Structure Types

| Type | Structure | Example | Breakdown |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Open | CV | 가 | ㄱ + ㅏ |
| Closed | CVC | 강 | ㄱ + ㅏ + ㅇ |
| Complex | CVCC | 값 | ㄱ + ㅏ + ㅂ + ㅅ |

- **Examples**: 박 (outside), 국 (soup), 책 (book)

#### ㄴ [n]
- **Sound**: Like 'n' in "sun"

**Vowel stem** (no batchim):
- 가다 (to go) + 아요 = 가요

**Consonant stem** (has batchim):
- 먹다 (to eat) + 어요 = 먹어요

When followed by a vowel, pronunciation changes:

| Base | + Vowel | Pronunciation | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------------|---------|
| 밥 | 밥을 | [바블] | rice (object) |
| 꽃 | 꽃이 | [꼬치] | flower (subject) |
| 옷 | 옷을 | [오슬] | clothes (object) |
| 없다 | 없어 | [업서] | to not exist |

1. "Supporting platform" - the consonant(s) that support the bottom of the syllable
2. 7 representative sounds: ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅇ
3. [ㄷ] sound (unreleased 't')
4. Any syllable ending in ㅁ, such as: 밤, 꿈, 감, 김, etc.
5. ㅇ (sounds like 'ng' in "sing")
6. [오ㄷ] - the ㅅ becomes [ㄷ] sound in final position
7. ㄱ is pronounced (닭 = [닥]), but when followed by vowel both may sound: 닭이 [달기]
8. [ㄱ], [ㄴ], [ㄷ], [ㄹ], [ㅁ], [ㅂ], [ㅇ]
9. 닭 (ㄷ + ㅏ + ㄹㄱ) - pronounced [닥] because ㄺ → [ㄱ] in final position
10. Only ㄲ can appear as a final consonant (and it's pronounced as [ㄱ]). The others (ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ) cannot appear in final position, though ㅆ becomes [ㄷ]
