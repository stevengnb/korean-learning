## Overview

Building a strong vocabulary foundation is essential for Korean language proficiency. This section covers the most common and useful words you'll encounter in daily life, organized by category for easier learning and retention.

## What You'll Learn

### Family Terms
Learn both formal and informal terms for family members, understanding the nuanced system that changes based on speaker's gender and formality level.

### Food and Dining
Master vocabulary for common Korean foods, restaurant situations, and describing tastes and preferences.

### Common Places
Build your vocabulary for everyday locations from homes and schools to shops and public facilities.

### Essential Verbs
Learn the 50 most frequently used verbs in Korean with practical example sentences showing real usage patterns.

### Essential Adjectives
Master descriptive words for people, objects, and situations that form the foundation of daily communication.

## Vocabulary Learning Strategies

### 1. Context Over Isolation

Always learn words in context, not as isolated vocabulary items. A word learned in a sentence is remembered better and used more accurately.

**Don't:** 먹다 = to eat
**Do:** 밥을 먹어요 = I eat rice/meal

### 2. Group by Theme

Learn related words together to build semantic networks in your brain. This section groups vocabulary thematically for this reason.

**Example:** When learning 아버지 (father), also learn 어머니 (mother), 부모님 (parents), etc.

### 3. Active Usage

Don't just read vocabulary - actively use it:
- Write example sentences
- Say words out loud
- Practice with exercises
- Use in conversation

### 4. Spaced Repetition

Review vocabulary at increasing intervals:
- Day 1: Learn new words
- Day 2: Review
- Day 4: Review
- Day 7: Review
- Day 14: Review
- Day 30: Review

### 5. Learn Word Families

Korean uses word building extensively. Learn related forms together:

**Example:**
- 공부 (study - noun)
- 공부하다 (to study)
- 공부방 (study room)
- 공부시간 (study time)

### 6. Notice Patterns

Korean vocabulary often follows patterns:
- Sino-Korean numbers in dates, money, addresses
- Native Korean numbers for age, items
- Counters for different object types

### 7. Use Multiple Senses

- **Visual:** Write words, use flashcards
- **Auditory:** Listen to pronunciation, repeat aloud
- **Kinesthetic:** Write by hand, type, use gestures
- **Contextual:** Use words in sentences and conversations

## Formal vs. Informal Vocabulary

Korean has distinct formal and informal vocabulary, especially for:

**Family terms:**
- Formal: 아버지 (father)
- Informal: 아빠 (dad)

**Daily objects:**
- Formal: 식사 (meal)
- Informal: 밥 (meal/rice)

**Tip:** Learn both forms but start with formal terms when uncertain. It's better to be overly polite than accidentally rude.

## Word Building Blocks

### Common Noun Suffixes

- **-자**: person who does (의사 = doctor, 기자 = reporter)
- **-실**: room (교실 = classroom, 화장실 = bathroom)
- **-점**: shop (빵점 = bakery, 서점 = bookstore)
- **-관**: building (도서관 = library, 영화관 = cinema)

### Verb + Noun Combinations

- **하다** verbs: 공부하다 (to study), 운동하다 (to exercise)
- **되다** verbs: 선생님이 되다 (to become a teacher)
- **주다** verbs: 가르쳐 주다 (to teach for someone)

## How to Use This Section

1. **Start with Categories Most Relevant to You**
   - If you love food, begin with food vocabulary
   - If you're living in Korea, prioritize places vocabulary

2. **Complete the Exercises**
   - Each page has 8-10 practice exercises
   - Check answers only after attempting all questions
   - Retry incorrect answers

3. **Create Your Own Sentences**
   - Use the vocabulary in your own example sentences
   - This personalizes learning and improves retention

4. **Track Your Progress**
   - Keep a vocabulary notebook
   - Note which words you struggle with
   - Review difficult words more frequently

5. **Practice Production, Not Just Recognition**
   - Don't just recognize words when you see them
   - Practice producing them in speech and writing
   - This is how you move from passive to active vocabulary

## Vocabulary Goals by Category

### Beginner Level (This Section)
- **Family:** 15-20 essential family terms
- **Food:** 30-40 common foods and restaurant phrases
- **Places:** 20-25 everyday locations
- **Verbs:** 50 most common verbs
- **Adjectives:** 50 most common adjectives

**Total target:** ~200-250 high-frequency words

## Integration with Grammar

Vocabulary and grammar work together. As you learn words:
- Notice particle usage (이/가, 을/를, 에, 에서)
- Pay attention to verb endings
- Observe sentence patterns
- See how adjectives modify nouns

The grammar sections complement vocabulary learning by showing you how to use these words correctly in sentences.

## Remember

**Quality over quantity:** It's better to know 100 words well (can use in sentences correctly) than to recognize 500 words but can't use them.

**Frequency matters:** Focus on high-frequency words first. The 1000 most common words account for ~80% of everyday conversation.

**Use it or lose it:** Vocabulary not used regularly fades. Regular practice and real-world usage are essential for retention.
