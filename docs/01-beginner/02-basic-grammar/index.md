# Korean Grammar Basics

!!! abstract "Quick Reference"
    Korean grammar fundamentals:

    - **Word Order**: Subject-Object-Verb (SOV)
    - **Particles**: Markers that show grammatical function
    - **No Articles**: No "a" or "the" equivalents
    - **Verb Endings**: Change based on formality and tense

## What Makes Korean Grammar Different?

Korean grammar differs significantly from English in several key ways:

### 1. Sentence Structure
Korean follows SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order, while English uses SVO (Subject-Verb-Object).

- English: I eat rice
- Korean: 저는 밥을 먹어요 (I rice eat)

### 2. Particles System
Particles are small markers attached to nouns that indicate their grammatical role. They are essential to Korean grammar.

| Particle | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 은/는 | Topic marker | 저는 (As for me) |
| 이/가 | Subject marker | 비가 (rain - subject) |
| 을/를 | Object marker | 물을 (water - object) |
| 에 | Location/time | 집에 (at home) |
| 에서 | Action location | 학교에서 (at school - doing something) |

### 3. Verb Conjugation
Verbs always come at the end and conjugate based on:

- **Formality level**: Formal, polite, casual
- **Tense**: Past, present, future
- **Mood**: Statement, question, command

### 4. No Plural Forms (Usually)
Korean doesn't always mark plurals explicitly. Context determines if something is singular or plural.

- 책 can mean "book" or "books"
- When needed, add 들: 책들 (books)

## Learning Strategy

1. **Master sentence structure first** - Understand SOV order
2. **Learn particles systematically** - Start with topic/subject, then object, then location
3. **Practice with real sentences** - Don't just memorize rules
4. **Pay attention to context** - Particle choice often depends on what you want to emphasize
5. **Accept that particles take time** - Even advanced learners sometimes struggle with particle nuances

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using English word order
- Wrong: 저는 먹어요 밥을 (I eat rice)
- Right: 저는 밥을 먹어요 (I rice eat)

### Mistake 2: Forgetting particles
- Wrong: 저 학생 (I student)
- Right: 저는 학생이에요 (I am a student)

### Mistake 3: Confusing 에 and 에서
- Wrong: 도서관에 공부해요 (I study at library - with 에)
- Right: 도서관에서 공부해요 (I study at library - with 에서)

### Mistake 4: Overusing 이/가
- Often unnatural: 저가 학생이에요
- More natural: 저는 학생이에요
