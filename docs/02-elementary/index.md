# Elementary Level (초급)

Welcome to the Elementary level of Korean learning. At this stage, you'll expand your communication abilities by learning how to connect ideas, express conditions, and use various verb forms that are essential for everyday conversation.

## What You'll Learn

### Sentence Connectors (01-connectors)
Master the art of linking sentences and clauses to create more natural, flowing Korean:

- **And connector** (-고): Connect sequential and simultaneous actions
- **Because/Reason** (-서 vs -니까): Express cause and reason with nuanced differences
- **But/Contrast** (-지만 vs -는데): Show contrast and set context appropriately
- **If/Conditional** (-면): Express conditions and hypothetical situations
- **When/Time** (-을 때, -자마자, -고 나서): Describe timing relationships

### Verb Forms (02-verb-forms)
Express desires, abilities, and experiences:

- **Want to** (-고 싶다): Express personal desires and observe others' wants
- **Can/Cannot** (-ㄹ 수 있다/없다): Discuss ability and possibility with precision
- **Try to** (-아/어 보다): Talk about experiences and attempts

## Learning Approach

At the Elementary level, focus on:

1. **Nuanced differences**: Many Korean grammar patterns seem similar but carry different nuances. Pay attention to the subtle distinctions.
2. **Natural flow**: These patterns help you move beyond choppy, simple sentences to more natural speech.
3. **Context awareness**: Korean grammar is highly context-dependent. Learn when each pattern is most appropriate.
4. **Practice combinations**: Try combining multiple patterns as you become comfortable with each one.
