# But Connector: -지만 vs -는데

!!! abstract "Quick Reference"
    **Pattern 1**: Verb stem + 지만 = "but, however" (direct contrast)
    **Pattern 2**: Verb stem + 는데/은데/ㄴ데 = "but, and, while" (context setting, softer contrast)
    **Key Difference**: -지만 = sharp contrast | -는데 = background info, softer contrast, multi-purpose

## Key Differences Between -지만 and -는데

### 1. Contrast Strength

**-지만**: Direct, clear-cut contrast (A but B)
- Strong opposition between clauses
- Similar to English "but" or "however"

**-는데**: Softer contrast, often providing background
- Less confrontational
- More flexible in meaning

**Examples**:
- 비싸지만 샀어요.
  *It was expensive, but I bought it.* (clear opposition)

- 비싼데 샀어요.
  *It's expensive, but/and I bought it.* (softer, could imply surprise or just providing info)

### 2. Multiple Functions of -는데

Unlike -지만 (which only shows contrast), -는데 has several functions:

#### A. Background Information
Setting the scene for the main clause:

- 저는 학생인데, 무엇을 도와드릴까요?
  *I'm a student, (so) what can I help you with?*

#### B. Softer Contrast
Less confrontational than -지만:

- 한국 음식을 좋아하는데 매운 음식은 못 먹어요.
  *I like Korean food, but I can't eat spicy food.*

#### C. Asking Questions Politely
-는데 can soften questions, making them less direct:

- 지금 시간 있으신데 같이 갈까요?
  *You have time now, so shall we go together?*

#### D. Expressing Surprise or Unexpectedness
When the second clause is surprising:

- 어제 공부를 안 했는데 시험을 잘 봤어요.
  *I didn't study yesterday, but (surprisingly) I did well on the exam.*

#### E. Trailing Off (Unfinished Sentences)
-는데 can end a sentence, leaving the implication unsaid:

- 배가 고픈데...
  *I'm hungry (and... [implying: let's eat, what should we do?])*

- 미안한데...
  *I'm sorry but... [implying: I have a request or problem]*

### 3. Formality

**-지만**: Neutral formality, widely used
**-는데**: Slightly more casual, very common in spoken Korean

### 4. Sentence Ending

**-지만**: Rarely ends sentences (needs a second clause)
**-는데**: Can end sentences (especially in conversation)
