# Because Connector: -서 vs -니까

!!! abstract "Quick Reference"
    **Pattern 1**: Verb stem + 아서/어서/여서
    **Pattern 2**: Verb stem + (으)니까
    **Meaning**: "because, so, since"
    **Key Difference**: -서 = natural consequence, objective | -니까 = subjective reason, justification

## Detailed Explanation

Both -서 and -니까 express cause and reason, but they have important nuanced differences in usage, formality, and the relationship between clauses.

### Formation Rules

#### -아서/어서/여서
Follow vowel harmony rules:

1. **Stem ends in 아 or 오** → 아서
   - 가다 → 가서
   - 좋다 → 좋아서

2. **Stem ends in other vowels** → 어서
   - 먹다 → 먹어서
   - 읽다 → 읽어서

3. **하다 verbs** → 여서 (often contracts to 해서)
   - 공부하다 → 공부하여서 → 공부해서

#### -(으)니까
Based on final consonant:

1. **Stem ends in vowel or ㄹ** → 니까
   - 가다 → 가니까
   - 만들다 → 만드니까 (ㄹ drops)

2. **Stem ends in consonant** → 으니까
   - 먹다 → 먹으니까
   - 읽다 → 읽으니까

## Key Differences Between -서 and -니까

### 1. Subjectivity Level

**-서**: Objective, natural consequence
- States facts and obvious connections
- The result follows naturally from the cause

**-니까**: Subjective reasoning, justification
- Speaker's interpretation or reasoning
- Often used when explaining or justifying

**Examples**:
- 비가 와서 길이 젖었어요.
  *It rained, so the street is wet.* (natural consequence)

- 비가 오니까 우산을 가져가세요.
  *Since it's raining, take an umbrella.* (speaker's suggestion based on rain)

### 2. Commands and Suggestions

**-서**: CANNOT be used with commands, suggestions, or requests in the second clause

**-니까**: CAN be used with commands, suggestions, or requests

- ❌ 추워서 창문을 닫으세요.
- ✓ 추우니까 창문을 닫으세요.
  *It's cold, so please close the window.*

- ❌ 늦어서 빨리 가세요.
- ✓ 늦으니까 빨리 가세요.
  *We're late, so please go quickly.*

### 3. Speaker's New Realization

**-니까**: Can express a new realization or discovery
**-서**: Does not carry this meaning

- 집에 가니까 아무도 없었어요.
  *When I went home, (I found/realized) no one was there.*

### 4. Formality and Strength

**-니까**: Stronger, more direct, can sound formal or assertive
**-서**: Softer, more natural in casual conversation

### 5. Question Form

**-니까**: Can be used in questions (asking for the listener's reason)
**-서**: Cannot be used in questions

- 왜 학교에 안 가니까?
  *Why aren't you going to school?*
