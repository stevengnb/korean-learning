# Sentence Connectors (연결어미)

Sentence connectors are grammatical endings that link clauses together, allowing you to express complex ideas in a single flowing sentence. They are essential for natural Korean speech and writing.

## Why Connectors Matter

In Korean, stringing together multiple simple sentences sounds choppy and unnatural:

**Choppy**: 저는 집에 갔어요. 저는 밥을 먹었어요.
**Natural**: 저는 집에 가서 밥을 먹었어요.

Connectors create the flow that native speakers use constantly in everyday conversation.

## Types of Connectors

### Sequential and Simultaneous Actions
- **-고**: Links actions in sequence or happening at the same time

### Cause and Reason
- **-서**: Natural consequence, objective reason
- **-니까**: Subjective reason, stronger connection to the result
- Learn about: [Because Connector](because-connector.md)

### Contrast and Background
- **-지만**: Direct contrast, "but/however"
- **-는데**: Sets context, softer contrast, introduces background information
- Learn about: [But Connector](but-connector.md)

### Conditions
- **-면**: General conditional "if"
- **-다면**: Hypothetical "if it were"
- **-(으)려면**: "If you intend to/in order to"

### Timing
- **-을 때**: "When" (at the time of)
- **-자마자**: "As soon as"
- **-고 나서**: "After doing"
- Learn about: [When Connector](when-connector.md)

## Common Patterns

Most connectors attach to verb stems and follow predictable patterns:

1. **Verb stem** + connector ending
2. Some require different forms based on tense
3. Consonant vs vowel endings may differ

## Learning Strategy

1. Start with **-고** and **-서** as they're the most frequently used
2. Master the nuanced differences between similar connectors (-서 vs -니까, -지만 vs -는데)
3. Practice each connector in multiple contexts
4. Listen for these patterns in Korean media to understand natural usage

## Important Notes

- The first clause with a connector typically does NOT take tense markers (past/future)
- The tense is usually shown only in the final verb of the sentence
- Some connectors can be used in both formal and informal situations, while others are more restricted
