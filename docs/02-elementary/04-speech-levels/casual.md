## Detailed Explanation

### What is 반말?

반말 (literally "half speech") refers to informal, casual speech. It's called 해체 in formal linguistic terms. This level removes the politeness marker -요 and uses casual endings.

**Key characteristic:** No -요 ending, creates intimacy and casualness

**Relationship indicator:** Using 반말 signals:
- Close friendship
- Family bonds
- Higher social position speaking to lower
- Adult speaking to child
- Comfortable, intimate relationship

### Formation Rules

반말 follows the same vowel harmony as 해요체, but removes -요:

**1. ㅏ/ㅗ stems → -아**
```
가다 → 가 (go)
오다 → 와 (come)
보다 → 봐 (see)
자다 → 자 (sleep)
```

**2. Other vowels → -어**
```
먹다 → 먹어 (eat)
서다 → 서 (stand)
읽다 → 읽어 (read)
```

**3. 하다 verbs → 해**
```
공부하다 → 공부해 (study)
일하다 → 일해 (work)
좋아하다 → 좋아해 (like)
```

**4. Descriptive verbs (adjectives):**
Can use plain -다 form in casual statements
```
크다 → 크다 / 커 (is big)
예쁘다 → 예쁘다 / 예뻐 (is pretty)
좋다 → 좋다 / 좋아 (is good)
```

### Conjugation Patterns

**Present tense statements:**
- 가 (go/goes)
- 먹어 (eat/eats)
- 해 (do/does)

**Present tense questions:**
- Verb stem + -니? / -냐? (more casual)
- 가니? / 가? (Are you going?)
- 먹니? / 먹어? (Are you eating?)

**Past tense:**
- Add -았/었/했 (same as 해요체 but no 요)
- 갔어 (went)
- 먹었어 (ate)
- 했어 (did)

**Future tense:**
- Verb stem + -(으)ㄹ 거야
- 갈 거야 (will go)
- 먹을 거야 (will eat)

**Commands (해라체):**
- Verb stem + -아/어/해
- 가! (Go!)
- 먹어! (Eat!)
- Same form as statements but with commanding tone

### Question Endings in 반말

Several ways to form questions in 반말:

**1. Rising intonation:**
- 가? (Going?)
- 먹어? (Eating?)

**2. -니? / -니 (softer):**
- 가니? (Are you going?)
- 뭐 하니? (What are you doing?)

**3. -냐? (more direct, often masculine):**
- 가냐? (Are you going?)
- 뭐 하냐? (What are you doing?)

**4. -어? (casual, common):**
- 어디 가? (Where are you going?)
- 좋아? (Is it good?)

### 반말 vs 해요체

| Feature | 반말 | 해요체 |
|---------|------|--------|

| Use | Friends, family | Most situations |
| Example | 뭐 해? | 뭐 해요? |

**Switching from 해요체 to 반말:**
```
Initial meeting: 어디 가세요? (Where are you going?) - very polite
After rapport: 어디 가요? (Where are you going?) - polite
Close friends: 어디 가? (Where are you going?) - casual
```

**3. Using 반말 with elders:**
❌ To older person: 뭐 해?
✓ To older person: 뭐 하세요?

6. 나 배고파. or 나는 배고파.

7. 나 (I) and 내 (my)
   Compare to polite: 저 (I) and 제 (my)

8. 봤어?

   A: 나 친구들이랑 놀러 갔어.
   B: 어디 갔는데?

   B: Sounds good! When should we go?
   A: How about next weekend?
   B: Perfect. Contact me!

10. It's appropriate to switch from 해요체 to 반말 when:

    **Conditions:**
    - Both people are similar age (same age or close)
    - You've established some rapport and comfort
    - The older person suggests it first (usually with "반말 하자")
    - Or same-age friends mutually agree (우리 반말 할까?)
    - The relationship has developed to a comfortable level

    **Process:**
    - Start with 해요체 when you first meet
    - Build rapport over time (could be one meeting or several)
    - Wait for social cues or explicit permission
    - Once agreed, maintain 반말 consistently in casual contexts

    **Never switch if:**
    - The person is clearly older (more than a year or two)
    - You're in a professional/work relationship
    - The other person hasn't reciprocated or agreed
    - You're in a formal setting

    When in doubt, maintain 해요체. It's better to be too polite than too casual.
