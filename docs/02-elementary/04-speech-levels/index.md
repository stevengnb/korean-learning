!!! abstract "Quick Reference"
    Korean has 7 traditional speech levels, simplified to 4 practical levels in modern usage:

    - **비격식체 (Informal Polite)**: 해요체 - 해요/아요/어요 (most common, everyday polite)
    - **비격식체 (Informal Casual)**: 해체 - 해/아/어 (반말, friends, family, younger people)
    - **격식체 (Formal Casual)**: 하게체 - 하게 (rare, elderly to younger adults)

## Understanding Speech Levels

Speech levels (높임말/반말) are one of the most distinctive features of Korean. They reflect social relationships, age, status, and context. Using the appropriate level is crucial for natural, respectful communication.

### The Traditional Seven Levels

Historically, Korean has seven speech levels, but modern usage focuses on three main levels:

1. **합쇼체** (Formal Polite) - -습니다/ㅂ니다
2. **해요체** (Informal Polite) - -아요/어요/해요
3. **해체** (Informal Casual/반말) - -아/어/해

**Less common levels:**
4. **하게체** - Used by elderly to younger adults
5. **하오체** - Archaic formal
6. **하게체** - Archaic
7. **해라체** - Commands, writing

### Modern Practical Levels

For learners, focus on these three:

#### 1. 합쇼체 (Formal Polite)
**Endings:** -습니다/ㅂ니다 (statement), -습니까/ㅂ니까 (question)

**When to use:**
- News broadcasts
- Public announcements
- Business presentations
- Meeting someone very senior
- Military/police contexts
- Formal speeches

**Formality:** Very high
**Distance:** Creates respectful distance

#### 2. 해요체 (Informal Polite)
**Endings:** -아요/어요/해요

**When to use:**
- Daily conversations with strangers
- Service interactions (stores, restaurants)
- Talking to colleagues
- Speaking to someone older you don't know well
- Most versatile and common level

**Formality:** Medium-high (polite but friendly)
**Distance:** Respectful but approachable

#### 3. 해체 (Informal Casual/반말)
**Endings:** -아/어/해, -다

**When to use:**
- Close friends of similar age
- Speaking to younger people/children
- Family members (varies by family)
- Between couples
- After mutual agreement to use 반말

**Formality:** Low (casual, friendly)
**Distance:** Close, intimate

### Hierarchy of Formality

```
Most Formal
    ↑
합쇼체 (-습니다/ㅂ니다)
    |
해요체 (-아요/어요/해요) ← Default for most situations
    |
해체 (-아/어/해) 반말
    ↓
Least Formal
```

### Key Factors in Choosing Speech Levels

**1. Age (나이)**
- Older person: Use polite forms (해요체 or 합쇼체)
- Same age/younger: Can use 반말 after establishing rapport
- Korean age vs international age matters

**2. Social Status (지위)**
- Boss, teacher, senior: Use polite forms
- Colleague of same rank: Usually 해요체
- Junior/subordinate: 해요체 or 반말 depending on relationship

**3. Relationship (관계)**
- Strangers: Always 해요체 or higher
- Acquaintances: 해요체
- Close friends: 반말
- Family: Varies (often 반말 to younger, 해요체 to elders)

**4. Context (상황)**
- Formal settings: 합쇼체
- Casual settings: 해요체 or 반말
- Professional settings: 해요체 or 합쇼체

### Mixing Speech Levels (존댓말/반말)

**Don't mix within the same conversation partner:**
- ❌ 뭐 해요? 나 배고파. (Mixing polite and casual)
- ✓ 뭐 해? 나 배고파. (All casual)
- ✓ 뭐 해요? 저 배고파요. (All polite)

**Can adjust over time:**
- Start formal when meeting someone new
- Gradually shift to casual as relationship develops
- Usually the older person suggests: "반말 하자" (Let's speak casually)

### Common Mistakes

1. **Using 반말 too soon**
   - Wait for clear signals or mutual agreement
   - Better to be too polite than too casual

2. **Wrong level in professional settings**
   - Even with close colleague, maintain 해요체 in meetings
   - Context matters more than personal relationship

3. **Inconsistent levels**
   - Pick a level and stick with it
   - Switching mid-conversation is awkward

4. **Using 합쇼체 in daily conversation**
   - Sounds overly formal and stiff
   - 해요체 is appropriate for most situations

### Regional and Generational Differences

**Seoul/Standard:**
- Clear distinction between levels
- More likely to maintain formality longer

**Other regions:**
- May use 반말 more quickly
- Different dialect forms affect speech levels

**Younger generation:**
- May use 해요체 even with parents
- More flexible about 반말 among friends

**Older generation:**
- Stricter about hierarchy
- May use traditional forms like 하게체

### Practical Usage Tips

**When in doubt:**
1. Use 해요체 (safest default)
2. Mirror the other person's level
3. Ask if unsure: "반말 해도 돼요?" (Is it okay to speak casually?)

**Adjusting levels:**
- Formal to casual: Natural progression
- Casual to formal: Awkward, avoid going backwards

**In writing:**
- Formal documents: 합쇼체
- Emails to colleagues: 해요체
- Text messages to friends: 반말
- Social media: Depends on audience

1. 해요체 (Informal Polite) is the safest choice. If the situation is very formal, 합쇼체 may be appropriate.

2. 반말 means "casual/informal speech" or "low speech level" - the informal casual speech level used with friends, family, and younger people.

3. 해요체 (Informal Polite / -아요/어요/해요) is the most commonly used in daily life.

4. 합쇼체 (Formal Polite)

5. False. You should start with 해요체 and only switch to 반말 after establishing rapport or mutual agreement. Age alone doesn't automatically mean you can use 반말.

6. 반말 해도 돼요? (Is it okay to speak casually?)
   Alternative: 반말 할까요? (Shall we speak casually?)
   Mutual suggestion: 반말 하자. (Let's speak casually.)

7. (b) -아요 (also -어요, -해요)

8. No, you should not mix speech levels with the same conversation partner. Pick one level and maintain consistency.

9. It means "Let's speak casually/informally" - the older person is suggesting both parties drop formalities and use 반말. This is a friendly gesture that indicates comfort and closeness.

10. 합쇼체 is more formal than 해요체.
    Hierarchy: 합쇼체 (most formal) > 해요체 (polite) > 해체/반말 (casual)
