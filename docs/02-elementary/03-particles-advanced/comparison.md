    - **만큼**: "as much as" (equality - X equals Y in degree)
    - All attach directly to nouns without 받침 distinctions

## Detailed Explanation

### 보다 (Than)

Used for comparisons showing difference or superiority.

**Formation:**
- Noun + 보다
- No 받침 distinction

**Meaning:**
- "More than X"
- "Compared to X"
- Subject is greater/lesser than the noun with 보다

**Structure:**
```
[Comparison standard] + 보다 + [Subject] + 이/가 + [Adjective/Verb]
형보다 제가 키가 커요. (I am taller than my older brother.)
```

**Examples:**
```
어제보다 (than yesterday)
형보다 (than older brother)
이것보다 (than this)

```

### 처럼/같이 (Like)

Used to show similarity or likeness.

**Formation:**
- Noun + 처럼 or Noun + 같이
- No 받침 distinction
- 처럼 and 같이 are interchangeable in most contexts

**Meaning:**
- "Like X"
- "As X does"
- "Similar to X"

**Nuance difference:**

The word 같이 can mean both "like" (comparison) and "together" (accompaniment) depending on context.

```
친구같이 행동해요. (Acts like a friend.) - comparison
친구같이 갔어요. (Went together with friend.) - accompaniment

To avoid confusion, use 처럼 for comparisons or use 친구와 같이 (together with friend) for accompaniment.
```

```

**Usage note:**
