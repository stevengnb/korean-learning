## Detailed Explanation

### Three Levels of Formality

Korean has three main particles for "and" or "with," distinguished solely by formality level.

| Particle | Formality | Context | 받침 Rule |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| 와/과 | Formal | Writing, formal speech, presentations | 와 (no 받침), 과 (받침) |
| 하고 | Neutral | Everyday conversation, polite but comfortable | No distinction |
| (이)랑 | Casual | Close friends, family, children | 랑 (no 받침), 이랑 (받침) |

### 와/과 (Formal)

Used in formal writing and formal speech situations.

**Formation:**
- Noun without 받침 + 와
- Noun with 받침 + 과

**Examples:**
```
친구와 (with friend)
선생님과 (with teacher)
사과와 배 (apples and pears)
학생과 선생님 (students and teachers)
```

**When to use:**
- Academic papers
- Business documents
- News articles
- Formal presentations
- Official announcements

### 하고 (Neutral/Standard)

Most common in everyday spoken Korean.

**Formation:**
- Noun + 하고 (no 받침 distinction)

**Examples:**
```
친구하고 (with friend)
선생님하고 (with teacher)
사과하고 배 (apples and pears)
어머니하고 아버지 (mother and father)
```

**When to use:**
- Daily conversations
- Polite but not overly formal situations
- Speaking with classmates, colleagues
- Most versatile particle

### (이)랑 (Casual)

Used with close friends, family, or when speaking casually.

**Formation:**
- Noun without 받침 + 랑
- Noun with 받침 + 이랑

**Examples:**
```
친구랑 (with friend)
언니랑 (with older sister)
사과랑 배 (apples and pears)
오빠랑 동생 (older brother and younger sibling)
```

**When to use:**
- Close friends
- Family members
- Speaking to children
- Very casual situations

### Two Functions

All three particles serve two functions:

**1. Connecting nouns ("and"):**
- 사과와 바나나 (apples and bananas)
- 책하고 공책 (book and notebook)
- 커피랑 빵 (coffee and bread)

**2. Indicating accompaniment ("with"):**
- 친구와 영화를 봤어요. (I watched a movie with a friend.)
- 가족하고 저녁을 먹었어요. (I ate dinner with my family.)
- 동생이랑 놀았어요. (I played with my younger sibling.)

### Choosing the Right Level

**Formal (와/과):**
```
교수님과 상담했습니다. (I consulted with the professor.)
한국과 미국 (Korea and America)
```

**Neutral (하고):**
```
친구하고 쇼핑했어요. (I went shopping with a friend.)
커피하고 빵을 샀어요. (I bought coffee and bread.)
```

**Casual (이랑/랑):**
```
언니랑 영화 봤어. (I watched a movie with my older sister.)
이거랑 저거 다 줘. (Give me this and that.)
```

### Multiple Items

When listing multiple items, you can:
- Use the particle after each item
- Use the particle only after the last item
- Mix particles (though style consistency is better)

**Examples:**
```
Full particles:
사과와 배와 바나나 (apples and pears and bananas)

Last item only:
사과, 배, 바나나하고 포도 (apples, pears, bananas, and grapes)

Natural spoken form:
사과, 배, 바나나 이런 거 (apples, pears, bananas, things like that)
```

### 와/과 vs 하고 vs (이)랑 Summary

**Same meaning, different formality:**
- 친구와 갔어요. (formal)
- 친구하고 갔어요. (neutral) ← most common in speech
- 친구랑 갔어요. (casual)

All three sentences mean "I went with a friend," but the social context differs.

### When to Use

**Use 와/과 when:**
- Writing essays, reports, emails
- Formal speeches or presentations
- News or official contexts
- Want to sound more educated or polished

**Use 하고 when:**
- Everyday conversations
- Not sure which formality to use (safest choice)
- Speaking with acquaintances or colleagues
- Polite but natural situations

**Use (이)랑 when:**
- Talking to close friends
- Family conversations
- Speaking to or about children
- Very casual, comfortable contexts
