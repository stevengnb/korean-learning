# Advanced Particles Overview

!!! abstract "Quick Reference"
    Advanced particles add nuance and precision to Korean sentences. This section covers:
    - **도**: also, too, even
    - **만 vs 밖에**: only (positive vs negative contexts)
    - **부터/까지**: from/to (time and spatial ranges)
    - **와/과/하고/(이)랑**: with (formality levels)
    - **보다/처럼/같이/만큼**: comparison particles

## What Are Particles?

Particles (조사) are grammatical markers attached to nouns and pronouns to indicate their role in a sentence. Unlike basic particles (이/가, 은/는, 을/를), advanced particles add specific meanings like comparison, inclusion, exclusion, or ranges.

## Particle Categories

### 1. Inclusion/Addition
- **도**: Indicates "also," "too," or "even"
- Replaces subject and object particles
- Can emphasize unexpectedness

**Example:** 저도 학생이에요. (I'm also a student.)

### 2. Limitation/Exclusivity
- **만**: "only" in positive sentences
- **밖에**: "only" with negative verbs (emphasizes limitation)

**Example:**
- 물만 마셔요. (I drink only water.)
- 물밖에 안 마셔요. (I drink only water [and nothing else].)

### 3. Ranges
- **부터**: starting point (from)
- **까지**: ending point (to, until)
- Used for both time and space

**Example:** 월요일부터 금요일까지 (from Monday to Friday)

### 4. Accompaniment
- **와/과**: formal "and/with"
- **하고**: neutral "and/with"
- **(이)랑**: casual "and/with"

**Example:** 친구와 영화를 봤어요. (I watched a movie with a friend.)

### 5. Comparison
- **보다**: "than" (comparative)
- **처럼/같이**: "like" (similarity)
- **만큼**: "as much as" (equality)

**Example:** 형보다 키가 커요. (I'm taller than my older brother.)

## Particle Stacking

Some particles can be combined with other particles:

- 에서도 (even in/at)
- 한테도 (to someone too)
- 만큼은 (as much as [with topic emphasis])

**Examples:**
- 학교에서도 한국어를 공부해요. (I study Korean even at school.)
- 동생한테도 선물을 줬어요. (I gave a gift to my younger sibling too.)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using 이/가 with 도**
   - ❌ 저는 학생이가도 있어요.
   - ✓ 저도 학생이에요.

2. **Using 만 with negative verbs**
   - ❌ 물만 안 마셔요. (I don't drink only water [confusing])
   - ✓ 물만 마셔요. (I drink only water.)
   - ✓ 물밖에 안 마셔요. (I drink only water [emphatic].)

3. **Wrong formality level for 와/과/하고/(이)랑**
   - Know your context: formal writing vs casual speech

## Usage Tips

1. **Choose the right particle for context:**
   - Formal writing: 와/과
   - Daily conversation: 하고
   - Close friends/family: (이)랑

2. **Understand the nuance:**
   - 만 = neutral limitation
   - 밖에 = emphatic limitation (often implies "not enough")

3. **Pay attention to particle replacement:**
   - 도 replaces 이/가, 을/를
   - Many particles can be added after 에, 한테, etc.

4. **Time vs space particles:**
   - 부터/까지 work for both but have different connotations
   - 에서 (from [place]) vs 부터 (from [time])

1. 도

2. - 만: "only" with positive verbs (neutral)
   - 밖에: "only" with negative verbs (emphatic, implies limitation/insufficiency)

3. 도 (replaces the subject particle)

4. 와 (와/과 are formal, hago is neutral, (이)랑 is casual)

5. 9시부터 5시까지

6. 그는 저만큼 키가 커요.
   Alternative: 그는 저만큼 커요.

8. 보다

9. 친구랑 영화를 봤어요.
   Also acceptable: 친구하고 영화를 봤어요. (neutral)
