# Descriptive Verbs (Adjectives)

!!! abstract "Quick Reference"
    - Korean adjectives are actually **descriptive verbs** (형용사)
    - They conjugate like verbs but describe states, not actions
    - Key differences from action verbs: cannot take -고 있다, different past tense nuance
    - Conjugation: same vowel harmony rules as verbs
    - Two types: **Action verbs** (동사) vs **Descriptive verbs** (형용사)

## Detailed Explanation

### What Are Descriptive Verbs?

In Korean, words that function as adjectives in English are actually verbs that describe states or qualities. They end in -다 in dictionary form and conjugate similarly to action verbs.

**Examples:**
```
크다 (to be big)
작다 (to be small)
예쁘다 (to be pretty)
좋다 (to be good)
맛있다 (to be delicious)
```

### Action Verbs vs Descriptive Verbs

| Feature | Action Verbs (동사) | Descriptive Verbs (형용사) |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| Meaning | Actions, movements | States, qualities, conditions |
| Examples | 가다, 먹다, 보다 | 크다, 예쁘다, 좋다 |
| -고 있다 | ✓ Can use | ✗ Cannot use |
| Past tense | Completed action | Was in that state |
| Imperative | ✓ Can command | ✗ Cannot command |

### Conjugation Patterns

Descriptive verbs follow the same vowel harmony and conjugation rules as action verbs.

**Present Tense (Polite Informal):**
- ㅏ/ㅗ stem → -아요
- Other vowels → -어요
- 하다 → 해요

**Examples:**
```
크다 → 커요 (is big)
작다 → 작아요 (is small)
예쁘다 → 예뻐요 (is pretty)
좋다 → 좋아요 (is good)
많다 → 많아요 (is many/much)
적다 → 적어요 (is few/little)
```

**Past Tense:**
```
크다 → 컸어요 (was big)
작다 → 작았어요 (was small)
예쁘다 → 예뻤어요 (was pretty)
좋다 → 좋았어요 (was good)
```

**Future Tense:**
```
크다 → 클 거예요 (will be big)
작다 → 작을 거예요 (will be small)
예쁘다 → 예쁠 거예요 (will be pretty)
좋다 → 좋을 거예요 (will be good)
```

### Key Conjugation Differences

**1. Cannot use -고 있다**

Descriptive verbs describe states, not ongoing actions, so they don't use progressive forms.

❌ 예쁘고 있어요 (Wrong)
✓ 예뻐요 (Correct - is pretty)

❌ 좋고 있어요 (Wrong)
✓ 좋아요 (Correct - is good)

**2. Cannot use imperative forms**

You can't command someone to "be tall" or "be pretty."

❌ 커! (Wrong - "Be big!")
❌ 예뻐! (Wrong - "Be pretty!")

**3. Past tense nuance**

For descriptive verbs, past tense means the state existed in the past but may not now.

- 날씨가 좋았어요. (The weather was good [but not necessarily now].)
- 음식이 맛있었어요. (The food was delicious [I ate it already].)
