# Verb Forms (동사 형태)

At the Elementary level, you'll learn essential verb forms that allow you to express desires, abilities, and experiences. These forms are fundamental for natural conversation and expressing yourself beyond simple statements.

## Why These Verb Forms Matter

Basic Korean verbs tell you what happened, but these verb forms add crucial layers of meaning:

- **Want**: Express your desires and understand others' wishes
- **Can/Cannot**: Discuss abilities, possibilities, and limitations
- **Try**: Talk about experiences and attempts

These forms are used constantly in everyday Korean and are essential for intermediate-level fluency.

## Core Verb Forms

### Expressing Desire
- **-고 싶다**: "Want to" (for yourself)
- **-고 싶어하다**: "Wants to" (for others, based on observation)

### Expressing Ability and Possibility
- **-ㄹ/을 수 있다/없다**: "Can/cannot, be able to/unable to"
- **못**: "Cannot" (lack of ability)

## Formation Patterns

These verb forms follow predictable patterns:

1. **Connect to verb stems**: Remove 다 from the dictionary form
2. **Follow vowel harmony**: Many forms use 아/어 endings
3. **Irregular verbs**: Some verbs have special changes

## Common Usage

These verb forms frequently combine with other grammar patterns:

- **-고 싶으면**: If you want to...
- **-ㄹ 수 있을 때**: When you can...
- **-아 보고 나서**: After trying...

## Learning Strategy

1. **Master -고 싶다 first**: It's the most frequently used and easiest to form
2. **Understand the nuances**: -ㄹ 수 없다 vs 못 have subtle differences
3. **Practice combinations**: These forms work together naturally
4. **Listen actively**: Pay attention to these patterns in Korean media

## Important Notes

### First-Person vs Third-Person

Korean distinguishes between expressing your own feelings and describing others':

- **저는 가고 싶어요.** (I want to go.) - First person
- **그 사람은 가고 싶어해요.** (That person wants to go.) - Third person

This distinction is crucial for natural Korean!

### Formal vs Informal

These verb forms work in both formal and informal speech:

- Formal: -고 싶습니다, -ㄹ 수 있습니다
- Polite: -고 싶어요, -ㄹ 수 있어요
- Casual: -고 싶어, -ㄹ 수 있어

### Negative Forms

Each pattern has specific negative forms:

- -고 싶지 않다 (don't want to)
- -ㄹ 수 없다 / 못 (cannot)
- -아 본 적이 없다 (have never tried)
